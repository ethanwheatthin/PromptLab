# OllamaPromptLab: Chrome Extension Architecture

## Overview
OllamaPromptLab is a Chrome extension that enables users to connect to their local Ollama instance for advanced prompt engineering. The extension helps users create, test, and refine prompts for different LLM models installed on their machine.

## Key Features

### 1. Ollama Connection Management
- Configure connection to local Ollama instance (default: http://localhost:11434)
- Test connection and verify available models
- CORS issue handling with proper authorization

### 2. Model Management
- List available models from local Ollama instance
- Display model details (size, parameters, capabilities)
- Quick selection of models for prompt testing

### 3. Prompt Engineering Workspace
- Multi-tab prompt editor with syntax highlighting
- Template library with prompt engineering best practices
- System prompt and user prompt separation
- Parameter controls (temperature, top_p, etc.)

### 4. Prompt Testing & Iteration
- Real-time testing of prompts against selected models
- Side-by-side comparison of results from different models/prompts
- Response metrics (generation time, token usage)
- Prompt versioning and history

### 5. Prompt Library
- Save and organize custom prompts
- Categorize prompts by use case or model
- Export/import prompts for sharing

### 6. Learning Resources
- Built-in prompt engineering guides and tutorials
- Context-sensitive tips based on model selection

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Extension Components
- **Background Script**: Handles Ollama API communication
- **Popup UI**: Quick access to models and recent prompts
- **Main Application Page**: Full prompt engineering workspace
- **Content Script**: (Optional) For webpage context extraction

### 2. Data Flow
1. User configures connection to local Ollama instance
2. Extension fetches available models
3. User selects model and creates/edits prompts
4. Prompts are sent to Ollama API
5. Responses are displayed and can be saved/compared

### 3. API Integration
- Use Ollama API endpoints:
  - `/api/models` - List available models
  - `/api/generate` - Text generation
  - `/api/chat` - Chat completion
  - `/api/embeddings` - (Optional) For advanced features

### 4. Security Considerations
- Extension operates only on localhost connection by default
- Request permission for local connection access
- User authorization for domain-based requests
- No data sent to external servers

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- Basic extension setup with connection to Ollama
- Model listing and selection
- Simple prompt editor and testing

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Template library and versioning
- Multi-model comparison
- Parameter tuning interface

### Phase 3: Enhancements
- Prompt library with organization features
- Learning resources integration
- Export/import functionality

## User Experience Flow

1. **Installation**: User installs extension and ensures Ollama is running locally
2. **Configuration**: User verifies connection to Ollama
3. **Model Selection**: User selects from available local models
4. **Prompt Creation**: User creates/selects prompt templates
5. **Testing**: User tests prompts and views responses
6. **Iteration**: User refines prompts based on results
7. **Organization**: User saves successful prompts to library

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Use Manifest V3 for Chrome extension
- Handle CORS by setting proper permissions in manifest.json
- Connect to Ollama API using fetch API with proper error handling
- Use React for UI components for maintainability
- Implement local storage for prompt history and settings
